# ChoreBucks Web App

This is my second project as a student of Get Coding. This web app is written in ReactJS.
This web app allows families to create a fun chore list for kids to complete and earn points towards wish list list items that they add to their wish list. Trade in points to pay for their wish list items. This app will allow kids to learn the value of money in a fun way!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
