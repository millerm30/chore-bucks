This is my second project as a student of Get Coding. This web app is written in ReactJS and uses Tailwind for styling.
This idea came from dealing with my own daughter and trying to find a way to make completing any chores she was given something that would provide interest for her to complete using technology as she lives and breaths all day!
This app allows families to create a fun chore list for kids to complete and earn points towards wish list items that they add to their wish list. Trade in points to pay for their wish list items, allowing kids to learn the value of money in a fun way!

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
